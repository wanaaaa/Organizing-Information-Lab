     * All valid numbers in these arrays are greater than 0.

     * array1 has enough empty space (represented by the value 0) to hold all valid values from the original two arrays
     * combined. The returned array must be array1 with the new values merged in.

     *      array1 = [1,4,7,9,0,0,0]
     *      array2 = [1,5,11]
     *      returned array = [1,1,4,5,7,9,11]

     * No test cases are provided for this method, you will need to test it on your own.
